# CryptoClustering

# Activity
In this challenge, you’ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## First Question : What is the best value of k ?
- According to the graph, the value 4 might be the best value.

## Second Question : What is the total explained variance of the three principal components ?
- The total explainec variance is around 89,5%

## Third Question : What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?  Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
- The best value is 4.
- The previous value is the same but with the pca is more distinct.

## Fourth question : After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
- In the original data, one of the cluster (2) is in the middle of the cluster n°3. Therefore, with the PCA data, it distincts all the clusters thus it is more clear for a better leaning model.
